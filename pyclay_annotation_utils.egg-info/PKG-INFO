        ## Installation
        ### Install From Github
        
        ```console
        # For installing from the master branch (stable)
        pip install https://github.com/cm107/annotation_utils/archive/master.zip
        
        # For installing from the development (latest)
        pip install https://github.com/cm107/annotation_utils/archive/development.zip
        ```
        
        Note: If you want to reinstall all dependencies while installing, use the following commands instead:
        ```console
        # For installing from the master branch (stable)
        pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/cm107/annotation_utils/archive/master.zip
        
        # For installing from the development (latest)
        pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/cm107/annotation_utils/archive/development.zip
        ```
        
        ### Install From Pypi
        ```console
        pip install pyclay-annotation_utils
        ```
        
        Note: The github package is updated more often than the pypi package.
        
        ## Update Build
        If you change the code and want to re-build the package, do the following.
        
        ```console
        ./build_package.sh
        ```
        
        The package can then be installed locally.
        ```console
        pip install -e .
        ```
